# Learning C++ Functional Programming
This is the code repository for [Learning C++ Functional Programming](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-c-functional-programming?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787281974), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Functional Programming allows developers to divide programs into smaller, reusable components that eases the creation, testing, and maintenance of software as a whole. Combined with the power of C++, you can develop robust and scalable applications that fulfill modern day software requirements. This book will help you discover all C++17 features that can be applied to build software in a functional way.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

All the code files are present in their respective folders

The code will look like the following:
```
    int add(int i, int j)

    {
   
        return i + j;
   
     }
```

To walk through this book and successfully compile all the source code examples, you will require a personal computer that runs Microsoft Windows 8.1 (or later) and contains the following software:


* The latest version of GCC, which supports C++11, C++14, and C++17 (during the writing of this book, the latest version was GCC v7.1.0)

* The Microsoft C++ compiler provided in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 for supporting C++11, C++14, and C++17 (for Chapter 7, Running Parallel Execution Using Concurrency)

* Code::Blocks v16.01 (all sample code is written using the Code::Blocks IDE; however, it's optional to use this IDE)
